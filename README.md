Electricity: Unit Generator & Bill Calculator

An educational application for teaching children (ages 7-12) about electricity usage and billing, using an interactive, game-like interface.

Introduction

Understanding the basics of electricity—its flow and how household appliances use it—is often difficult for children in the age range of 7-12. This application aims to teach kids these concepts in an engaging, fun, and interactive way. It uses a combination of visuals, drag-and-drop interactions, and educational content to simplify complex topics like electricity and fuel usage.

The goal is to provide an alternative method for learning that integrates both education and entertainment, especially for children in schools that may not have access to advanced tools like animations or interactive learning systems.
